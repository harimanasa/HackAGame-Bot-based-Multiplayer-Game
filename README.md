# Silly-Billy-Multiplayer-Game
A multiplayer game:

You're alone in your home and you are missing your friends. You have got nothing much to talk about.
So you invite them to play a self-paced game and compete with them over fun facts.

All you need is: you having friends. 

Here's a sample for you:
